### Walkthrough

I sent email explaining licecap's failure to be able to capture images on an auxiliary screen.  Since the emulator 
phone screen is too large to fit on my mac's screen, thus requiring me to use an aux screen, licecapture 
is thus impossible with my hardware/OS/licecap configuration.
