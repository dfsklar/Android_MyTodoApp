### Walkthrough

I sent email explaining licecap's failure to be able to capture images on an auxiliary screen.  Since the emulator 
phone screen is too large to fit on my mac's screen, thus requiring me to use an aux screen, licecapture 
is thus impossible with my hardware/OS/licecap configuration.

### Issues / Questions

1) Would be nice to have an emulator that supports scaling down so the phone screen can fit on my mac.  How can
one facilitate such?

2) I could not figure out how to give a title to my "edit item" screen.  I'd love to learn how to do so.

3) I saw your suggested .gitignore too late and probably committed many derived files that should not
be present in github, my apologies!
